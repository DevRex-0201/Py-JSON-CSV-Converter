# JSON to CSV Converter

This script is designed to convert multiple JSON files into a single CSV file. It utilizes the Python programming language and standard libraries such as `os`, `json`, and `csv`. The purpose is to streamline the process of handling and analyzing JSON data by consolidating it into a CSV format.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The script uses only standard libraries, so no additional installations are required.

## Usage

1. Place your JSON files in a directory (specified by the `json_files_path` variable).

2. Set the output CSV file path using the `csv_file_path` variable.

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

## Script Explanation

1. **JSON Files Path:**
   - Set the `json_files_path` variable to the directory containing your JSON files.

2. **Output CSV File:**
   - Set the `csv_file_path` variable to specify the location and name of the output CSV file.

3. **Data Extraction:**
   - The script iterates through each JSON file in the specified directory.
   - It loads the JSON data using the `json` library and appends it to a list (`all_data`).

4. **CSV Writing:**
   - The script then writes the accumulated JSON data to a CSV file using the `csv.DictWriter` class.
   - The fieldnames for the CSV header are derived from the keys of the first JSON file encountered.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that the JSON files in the specified directory have a consistent structure.

- The CSV file will have a header row based on the keys of the first JSON file processed.

- The script assumes that all JSON files have the same structure. If there are variations, additional handling may be needed.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided for general use and may require adjustments based on the specific structure and requirements of your JSON data. It is recommended to review the resulting CSV file to ensure data integrity. The author is not responsible for any misuse or data loss resulting from the use of this script.
